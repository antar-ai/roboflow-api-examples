# Rock-Paper-Scissors Detection and Winner Determination

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game with image recognition to detect the hand gestures of players and determine the winner. The goal is to provide a fun and interactive way to play the classic game using a computer vision-based approach.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Detection:** The system uses image recognition to detect the hand gestures of players as they make their choices (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).

- **Real-Time Processing:** The application processes the video stream in real-time, allowing players to make their choices seamlessly.

- **Winner Determination:** The system analyzes the gestures made by each player and determines the winner based on the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
